# SelenScript
SelenScript is a superset language for Lua, meaning any Lua code is valid SelenScript.  
The goal of SelenScript is to make Lua nicer to code, while also providing tools for the same reason.  

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of what SelenScript provides, besides the language;  
*Note, not everything listed is currently implemented, but is planned.*
- A library for parsing, understanding and outputting code.  
- Additional standard libraries.  
- Project diagnostics (error checking, warnings, etc)  
- Minification.  

For information on the SelenScript language, see **[selenscript.md](selenscript.md)**.
